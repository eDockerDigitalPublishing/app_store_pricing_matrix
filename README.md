Usage
-----

Suppose you find a device locale by `NSLocale` on an iOS device.

```objc
NSString* currency = [[NSLocale currentLocale] objectForKey:NSLocaleCurrencyCode];
```

That will give you the currency string like `USD` or `EUR`, and this library expects them as a key.

Some constants, useful for validation:

```ruby
AppStorePricingMatrix::CURRENCIES
 => ["USD", "CAD", "MXN", "AUD", "NZD", "JPY", "EUR", "DKK", "SEK", "CHF", "NOK", "GBP", "CNY", "SGD", "HKD", "TWD", "RUB", "TRY", "INR", "IDR", "ILS", "ZAR", "SAR", "AED"]
```

To retrieve a customer price, query with the currency and the tier number:

```ruby
AppStorePricingMatrix::CUSTOMER_PRICES['USD'][1]
 => "0.99"

AppStorePricingMatrix::CUSTOMER_PRICES['JPY'][1]
 => "85"
```

For developer proceeds:

```ruby
AppStorePricingMatrix::DEVELOPER_PROCEEDS['GBP'][30]
 => "12.78"
```

**NOTE!** The developer proceedings for `EUR` are for Finland.

Updating the price table
------------------------

The price table was generated by parsing the exhibit C part of the paid app contract PDF file. As of October 26, 2012, it was versioned as v14.

Prices were last updated on 17th of March 2015 from a HTML price table on iTunes Connect.

Since the PDF file was malformed, PDF parsing wasn't feasible. My current method to extract out the data semi-automatically is as follows, using Mac OS X 10.7:

1. Select a column vertically using mouse / trackpad from tier 0 through tier 87, covering pairs of a currency and its commission
2. Save it into a text file, naming with the currency - e.g. "usd.txt" under the "input" folder
3. Run `rake aspm:generate` to compile the input files into pricing data
4. Then run the spec to verify the generated content by `rake`
